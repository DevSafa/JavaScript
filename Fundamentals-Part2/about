strict mode
    * is a special mode that we can activate in javascript , 
    wich make it easy for us to write a secure javascript code.
    * to activate strict mode , all we have to do is write  'use strict';
    * we activate the strict mode for the entire script 
    *'use strict'; has to be the very first statement in the script
    * if we have any code before it , then strict mode will not be activated  
    * we can only avctivate strict mode for a specific function or a block .
    *'use strict; to write more secure code 
    * secure means  that strict mode makes it easy for us developpers to void accident errors
        basically it avoid us to introduce bugs in our code and that because of two reasons:
        -first  strict mode forbid us to do certain things
        -second it  create visible errors in the developper console where  in certain situations without 
        strict mode javascript would simply fail silently .
    *another thing that strict mode does, is to introduce a short list of variable names that are reserved for features that may be added to the language a bit later.

Functions
* a functions is  simply a piece of code that we can reuse over and over  again in our 
    code.
*don't repeat yourself.
*console.log is also a function ,  a built -in function , that we don't have to built our-self.

Function Declarations vs expressions

    * functions are just values , so we can store them in variables 
    * what is the big difference between function declaration and function expression ?
        the main practical  difference is that we can actually call function declaration before where they defined in the code . 
        if we attempt to do the same thing with function expression , it should not work .
