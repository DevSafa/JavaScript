*index.html is an html file because usually JavaScript is attached to web pages , 
    at lesat when we are building front end application.
* to start we always need an html document .
*in HTMl there is a script tag where we can write JavaScript

*developer console is just an environment that was built to execute small pieces of code
    and then shows results immediatly.

*whenever we want to access the developer console we use the console.log() function.
*console.log() is like building a bridge between our script  and the developer console on the other side.

<script>

     console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);
</script>

*the script tag in HTMl page is an inline script
*an inline script is a script that is not loaded from an external file , but embedded inside HTML
*the only  advantage of inline script is we don't have to load another file ,
    but on the other hand is pretty bad for separating the web site content from teh javascript logic,
    so usually we use external javaScript files.
*connecting HTML file  to JavaScript file is usually done at the end using script tag 
    and specifying the src attribute to specify the path to js file.
*Linking a JavaScript file    
    <script src ="script.js" ></script>
