*(command + option + j) (MAC) -> open up athe chrome  developer console in MAC
*elemnets , console , sources , Memory , ... are all developer tools
*second way to open  the developer tools -> right click -> inspect
*third way to open the developper tools ->chrome Menu->view->Developer->JavaScript console
*JavaScript console allows to write and test JavaScript code

----------------------
*alert is a js function , alert will pop up a window containing "Hello world!" string

        > alert("Hello world!")

*let define a variable

        > let js = 'amazing'


        > if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN!')

        > js = 'boring'
        < "boring"

        > if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN!')

*do some simple math operations 

        > 40+8+23-10
        < 61
----------------------

*JavaScript is a HIGH-LEVEL, OBJECTED-ORIENTED, MULTI-PARADIGM programming language
        *a programming language -> is basically just a tool that allows us to write code that will instruct a  computer
                to do some thing (Instruct computer to do things).
        *HIGHT-LEVEL language -> we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management
        *OBJECT-ORIENTED -> based on objects, for storing most kinds of data 
        *MULTI-PARADIGM language -> we can use different styles of programming (imparative and declarative programming) 
                use different ways to structuring our code.

*The role of JavaScript in WEB DEVELOPMENT
        *3 core technologies of the web are : HTML , CSS ,JavaScript -> these 3 work together to create beautiful ,
         interactive and dynamic web sites or web applications.
        *HTML is responsible for the content of the page , text , images , buttons , ...., all the content is always written in HTML
        *CSS is responsible for the presentation of that content , basically for styling 
        *JavaScript is the real programming language of the internet, allows developpers to add dynamic and interactive effect to any web page 
                we also use it to manipulate the content or the CSS , load data from remote servers , Building web application 
        *we can use analogy of NOUNS , ADJECTIVES ,VERBS
        *HTML -> NOUN (<p></p> means paragraph)
        *CSS ->ADJECTIVE (because it describe the noun) (p {color :red} means the paragraph text is RED)
        *JS  ->VERBS (p.hide() means hide the paragraph)

*JAVASCRIPT  allows us to add dynamic effects to pages , and in fact to build entire web aplications in the browser

*the JAVASCRIPT language and the web browser are actually two seperate things ->that means that javascript can 
        also run outside the web browser, for example it's possible to use java script on web server,
         using a very popular web technology called nodeJS which doesn't need any browser at all , 
         and that's allows us to create so called backend applications, which are simply applications that run in web server
         and interact with databases.

*when we use javascript in the browser, it creates so called front end applications
        MODERN javascript libraries and frameworks        (react vuejs angular +...).
*we can use also JavScript to build Native mobile applications(react native - ionic framework ) as well as native desktop applications (tools like electron).

*JavaScript releases :
        ES5(ECMAScript) ->ES6/ES2015->...->...->ES11/ES2020->...(New update to JS every single year)
        *ES6/ES2015(biggest update to the language ever)
        *(ES6/ES2015.......ES11/ES2020) (Modern javascript)

*learning JAVASCRIPT properly is the single best investement that you can make in your web developement cariere now >3 >3
