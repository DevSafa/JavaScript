Basic HTML Structure and Elements
---------------------------------
index.html is always the name of the 
main file in any project
-HTML stands for hypertext markup language
- we use it to describe the content of web pages basically
- HTML document is made of elements , we write elements using and opening 
and closing tag 
-the main element in all HTMl document is always html element

- <head></head> element is like the the settings of the page , is describing the text 
- what we put in the body is what is visible in the page 
- <!DOCTYPE html> identify that document is HTML 5
- <html lang="en"> telling the browser that we are using english language 

Attributes,Classes and IDs
-------------------------
-in HTMl ,element can have attribute , and this attribute  describes element
-href attribute stands for hypertext reference

- <a></a> the anchor element is an inline element
- <h1></h1> is a block element

- the image element needs also an attribute

- two very important attributes that we can actually use in all elements,
and which we can use to identify them, these are classes and Ids

- we use classes and IDs to essentially name elements so we can select them in CSS in order 
to style them . we also use IDs and classes to select elements from JavaScript when we do 
DOM manipulation

- classes and IDs are used to identify elements , specially classes
- difference between classes and iDs , is that IDs has to be unique , the ID can only be used once on the page
 while classes can be used over and over again ;
 i could have more paragraphs called second , i could not have another element called my-image

-in practice we almost never used IDs to style elements or to select them from javaScRIPT , IT's a good practice to use classes

- the most generic way to create boxes in HTMl is a div element 

- because we have a form , so instead of div we use form element

- div element is just a generic box which has no meaning at all , so we use form instead of div , because it has a meaning

Basic Styling with CSS
---------------------
- we use CSS to style elements
- the style counts as settings for an html page , so we need to put it in side the head element

- to style elements we need to first select them 
- there are different types of selectors in CSS
- the most basic selector is the element selector ; usinng teh element selctor we
can simply select all the elements of a certain type
  <style>
        body {
            background-color: green;
        }
    </style>
- each CSS declaration has a property name and a value
- usually we write CSS in an external CSS file like javaScript
- <link/> element does not create a clickable link like  anchor element
- we use <link/> to link css file to html file 
- font-family property is a property that get inhereted.
- in general most properties that are related to font are inherit
- h1 h2 has their predefined font-size.
- we use the dot for the class selector ; dot is for the class , first is the class name

- to select based on the ID we use the #
