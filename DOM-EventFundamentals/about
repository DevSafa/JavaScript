Guess My Number Project
-----------------------
- guess a number between 1 and 20 
- after a failed gess , the score decreases by 1 


- in javascript we can select an element based on it's classs
- like selecting elements in css , we can do the same with javascript
- before learning Dom and what's DOM manipulation , let's learn an easy way 
to select an html element  in javascript.
for that we write 
    document.querySelector()
querySelector() is a method available on the document Global_Objects
- into the method we need to pass a selector , and this selector is exactly the same selector that we could use in CSS.
    document.querySelector('.message) => if it wass a classs
    document.querySelector('#message) => if it was an instead


What's the DOM and DOM manipulation
-----------------------------------
-DOM stands FOR Document Object Model
-DOM is a dtructured representation of HTML Documents.
Allows javaScript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them .

-for example by using DOM manipulation WE WILL be able to change text , HTML attributes , and even CSS styles

- basically we can say that DOM is a connection point between HTML document and javascript code
- the DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon as the HTML loads
 , and it starts ina tree structure . (see What is DOM image)
- in the tree each HTML element is an object.
- when we talk about the DOM tree and DOM manipulation , we use the terms child element , parent element  and siblinng element and so on 
- for each element in the HTMl there is one element node in the DOM tree.
- we can access and interact with each of these nodes using JavaScript.
- the DOM always starts with the document object , and document is a special object that we have access to in javascript
- and this object (document) serves as an entry point to the DOM .
- the querySelector() method is a available in the document object .
- so document is the entry point to the DOM because we need it to start selecting elements.

- the first child element of the document is usually  the html element (the root elements in all html files ),...
- HTM has two childs elements head and body , in the html they are adjacent elements , and so they are 
    siblings in our DOM as well .
-DOM TREE HAS MORE THAT JUST ELEMENTS node
-it also has nodes for alla the text itself , comments , and other stuff
- the DOM is a complete representation of HTML document , so we can manipulate it in complex ways

- many people beleives that the DOM and all the methods and properties ,
    that we use to manipulate the DOM such as document or the query selector  and 
    lots of other stuff are actually part of javascript , 
    hoowever thiss is not the case

- remember that js is a ctually th e dialect of the EcmaScript specification
 and actually this DOM related stuff is simply not there , we had only use the javascript language itself

- but starting in this section we will also use javascript in a browser.
- sure we used the google chrome to run our code in the developer console , but that's not what i mean .
-what i mean is to manipulate webpages that are actually displayed and rendered in the browser
    just  like any normal website that you know 

- if the DOM is not a part of the JavaScript language , then how does this all work .
- the DOM and DOM  methods are actually part of something called the web APIs
, the web APIs are like libraries that browsers implements , and that we can acces 
from our javascript code .
- API stands for Applicatiom Programming Interface

- eb APIs are basically libraries that are also written in javascript
- we don't have to import or do anything.
- tehre is actually an official DOM specification that browsers implement
    which is the reason why DOM manipulation works the same in all browsers
- besides the DOM there are actually a ton more APIs such as Timers , Fetch APIs...
